Comment
-------
Thunderbirds was one of my most favolite TV program when I was
a child. I made a lot of Thunderbirds plastic models and enjoyed
playing with them. 

I usually don't create character icons. However, I happened to make
some Thunderbirds icons for my Nostalgic Toy icon set, and I decided
to make a separate set because Thunderbirds is special for me.

I hope you enjoy these icons!
