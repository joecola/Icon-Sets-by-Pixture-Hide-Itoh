Comment

I was going to make guitar icons a long time ago, but I was not really
good enough to make guitar icons at that time.  Since I was playing 
guitar in a hard rock band when I was young,  I have special feeling
about guitars, and I am glad that I was able to make this icon set finally.

To make an entire guitar into 32x32 dot size is a big challenge . 
As you may noticed, all the guitars has short-neck (^_^;). But this is 
the best I can do and I think I was able to express the delicate body curve
and color somehow.
